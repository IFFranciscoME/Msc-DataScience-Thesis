# -- 24.02.2021
- Fix: pickle tf.keras model with wrapper from scikit learn. 

# -- 25.02.2021
- Modification: Change nomenclature from Train-Test, to Train-Validation and Test (never seen data from 2021)

# -- 26.02.2021
- Addition: Implement embargo criteria for t-fold variation

# -- 27.02.2021
- Modification: Erase hadamard features, they add model complexity without being uniquely useful
- fix: Filtration of explanatory variables in the target variable, fixed to have  [y_t+1 | X_t]
