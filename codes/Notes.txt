# -- T-Fold method
# -- Divide all the data in T-folds
# -- With each T-Fold
# -- -- Create Autoregressive and Hadamard features 
# -- -- Create Symbolic Features
# -- -- Conduct the optimization process with genetic algorithms 
# -- -- Save the HoF with best N individuals (parameter set)
# -- -- Save the parameter set that produces the max, min value of the fitness metric (AUC)
# -- -- Search for the mode of parameter sets among all the T-Folds

# -- Calculate and plot model metrics in each T-Fold (for the entire Hall of Fame)
# -- -- metrics: AUC and ACC
# -- -- plots: all the ROCs + mean ROC + mean+1std ROCs

# -- (Pending) Extract Symbolic Feature generated in a Fold and use them in the rest of the folds
# -- (Pending) Extract optimal parameters found in a fold and use them in the rest of the folds
# -- (Pending) Reach the goal 1 and 2 with the "Best of the Hall of Fame of all of the Hall of Fames"
# -- (Pending) Reach the goal 1 and 2 with the "Worst of the Hall of Fame of all of the Hall of Fames"
# -- (Pending) Evaluate "best of the best" and "worst of the best"
# -- (Pending) Calculate and plot model metrics in global ("Best of the best" and "worst of the best")
# -- -- metrics: AUC and ACC
# -- -- plots: all the ROCs + mean ROC + mean+1std ROCs


# T-Folds Crossvalidation for Timeseries
# -- 2 academic references about the concept
