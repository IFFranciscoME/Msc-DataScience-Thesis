# -- AUC vs Logloss as cost functions, which is better for binary classification
Whereas the AUC is computed with regards to binary classification with a varying decision threshold,
logloss actually takes "certainty" of classification into account.

How to choose optimum probability threshold from ROC ?, since the ROC is calculated with variations
of the threshold used to classify into one clase or the other an observation. 

Therefore to my understanding, logloss conceptually goes beyond AUC and is especially relevant in cases
with imbalanced data or in case of unequally distributed error cost 
(for example detection of a deadly disease).

# -- Simpson paradox 
Simpson's paradox is one of many reasons why it’s important to evaluate your models on different slices 
of data. Model 1 outperforms Model 2 on group A and group B separately, but model 2 can still 
outperform model 1 with the overall data.

Here is a multivariable procedure that explicitly maximizes classification accuracy and prevents
paradoxical confounding. [5, 6]

One alternative is weights on the classes (more to the less frequent class), this appears to be restrictive to
the observed classes in the dataset but not necessarly of the underlying process that produces such observations, and
therefore it could be prone to increasing the generalization error. Another alternative is that dynamically update
the probability threshold to classify the predicted outpus, but this requires a 100% certainty in the ground truth
labels, whether are binary discrete classes or a high level of certainty in how a continuous value is classified as 
1 or 0. The proposition for the dynamic threshold is considering using bayes, the proportion of classes is calculated
with the onhand data as an intial expected class balance and update that numbner with new evidence of class balance within each new fold, with the option of including a divergence factor fiven by the KLDivergence of the previous data and the
present data.

# -- NOTES ON EXPERIMENTS 

# -- the order and nomenclature of sub-sets is: Train (stays the same), Validation (what conpcetually was test), 
Test a sub-data set used at the very final stage (never seen by any model under any situation)

# -- instead of auc-test, logloss-test, acc-test, i will add auc-diff, logloss-diff, acc-diff as the result of the
difference of the metric in train and in validation sets

# -- apparently, L1 and L2 regularizers for the kernel (applied to weights), is in the order of 0.001

# -- the ratio of generations is useful to be sufficient, like 10 or more, in order to provide several oportunities
of weight initialization at each block of epochs. That is, not varying too much the hyper parameters in order to
for the same hyperparameters find through several iterations the optimal weights.But after 8, it stopped to provide
sufficiently different individuals. 

# -- Dropout is applied to each hidden layer (so it is not applied to the input and the output). One connection
could be that getting the dropped inputs and compare them to the statistical properties of the inputs in that
particular fold, whether they were pre-processed (scaled or normalized)

# -- Note on simmetry when using integers as clases, if use -1, 0, +1, they have a simmetry at 0 ant apparently that
causes numerical instability in the output of the loss function (for the case of cross-entropy)

# -- ERRORS
tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError:  assertion failed: [predictions must be >= 0] 
[Condition x >= y did not hold element-wise:] [x (ann-mlp/output_layer/Sigmoid:0) = ] [[-nan][-nan][-nan]...] 
[y (Cast_8/x:0) = ] [0]

tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError:  assertion failed: [predictions must be >= 0]
 [Condition x >= y did not hold element-wise:] [x (ann-mlp/output_layer/Sigmoid:0) = ] [[0][0][0]...]
  [y (Cast_8/x:0) = ] [0]

- Big momentums appear to provoque nan error, so momentum 0.4 as max appear not to cause the error

- added an arbitrary result for both classes, to guarantee that everytime, at least, will be 1 of each class
  and that way the error of nans is avoided

- nan errors appears to be generated by an error of calculation in the loss function, when there wasnt enough cases of any 
  class or something alike

# -- TRAINING SCHEME FOR ANN-MLP -------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

One advantage of having callback is to set a large number of epochs and let the learning process progress indefinitely
until one condition is reach, it could be a divergence of the learning algorithm which results in a NaN reporte value
therefore trigger the TerminateOnNaN callback, other reason is the unimprovement of the accuracy metric for a continuous
number of examples, and also a high divergence in the similarity of distributions of the predicted values and the training
values. 

More on the divergence of the learning algorithm, the learning process is terminated for the entire batch whenever the cost
function presents a NaN value, possibly caused by a divergence of the learning algorithm working on the search space of the
cost function. This is implemented with TerminateOnNaN function. 

In reggards with monitoring accuracy rate dynamic under the definition of a logloss cost function, this is done with
EarlyStopping function.

ReduceLROnPlateau: Reducing the learning rate of the learning algorithm given an increasing rate of the divergence on the
distribution of the real value and the predicted value of the target variable.
