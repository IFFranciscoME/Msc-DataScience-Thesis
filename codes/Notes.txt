# T-Fold method
# -- Divide all the data in T-folds
# -- Create Symbolic Features in each T-Fold (add the entire HoF with best N individuals)
# -- Optimize parameters using Symbolic Features in each T-Fold (save the HoF with best N cases)
# -- Calculate and plot model metrics in each T-Fold (for the entire Hall of Fame)
# -- -- metrics: AUC and ACC
# -- -- plots: all the ROCs + mean ROC + mean+1std ROCs

# -- (Pending) Extract Symbolic Feature generated in a Fold and use them in the rest of the folds
# -- (Pending) Extract optimal parameters found in a fold and use them in the rest of the folds
# -- (Pending) Reach the goal 1 and 2 with the "Best of the Hall of Fame of all of the Hall of Fames"
# -- (Pending) Reach the goal 1 and 2 with the "Worst of the Hall of Fame of all of the Hall of Fames"
# -- (Pending) Evaluate "best of the best" and "worst of the best"
# -- (Pending) Calculate and plot model metrics in global ("Best of the best" and "worst of the best")
# -- -- metrics: AUC and ACC
# -- -- plots: all the ROCs + mean ROC + mean+1std ROCs
